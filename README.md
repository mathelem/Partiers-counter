🎉 TV Girl Partiers Counter
This is my first JavaScript project! It's a web app to track party attendees in a TV Girl-themed party. You can increment the count as people join and save records of past attendance. 🎶

Counter.html: Main HTML file with the count display and buttons.
counter.css: Styling (background image, buttons, fonts).
index.js: JavaScript logic for counting and saving.
🚀 Features
INCREMENT: Add 1 to the count each time it's clicked.
SAVE: Log the count and reset it to zero.
